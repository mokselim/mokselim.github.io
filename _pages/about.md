I am a physicist turned neuroscience researcher focused on advancing brain structure and function understanding through data science and neuroradiology, aiming to improve diagnostics and treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.

I completed my PhD at the Institute of Neurosciences in Alicante under Prof. Santiago Canals and Dr. Silvia de Santis, studying white matter disruption in alcohol use disorder and demonstrating the neuroprotective effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) via multimodal neuroimaging and psychological assessments.

My postdoctoral work at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, University of Nottingham (UK), in Prof. Stamatios Sotiropoulos’ group, as part of the NIH-funded BRAIN Initiative, focused on mesoscale connectomics and advanced diffusion MRI modeling to enhance brain tractography accuracy. This involved collaborations with the University of Oxford and the University of Minnesota.

Additional experience includes a research internship at Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels), applying machine learning to identify digital biomarkers for alcohol detoxification, and advanced training at UCLouvain (Belgium), LMU (Germany), Karolinska Institute (Sweden), and Radboud University (Netherlands).

I was awarded the INPhINIT "la Caixa" Foundation Fellowship (EU co-funded) for my PhD and the Severo Ochoa Master Scholarship (CSIC) for my Master’s degree. My international mobility was supported by Miguel Hernández University and the European University of Neurotechnology (Neurotech-EU).

Currently, I am Technical Manager of the Preclinical MRI Facility at the Institute of Neuroscience of Alicante and an Associate Research Fellow at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre (UK) and Schulich School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario (Canada).
